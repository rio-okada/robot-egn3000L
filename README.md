# robot-egn3000L
Robot program for Foundation of Engineering Lab course (still in development)

Our robot will follow a line using two IR sensors mounted at the front, and avoid collisions by measuring distance with a ultrasound sensor.  We will add extra functionalities such as blinking LEDs and/or LCD for displaying status.  The line following algorithm will be executed by Arduion nano which we are programming using platform.io.
